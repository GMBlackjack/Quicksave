# Quicksave

This repository is the personal worked-problems storage of Gabriel M Steward (me!). It contains homework problems for various graduate-level coursework, problems done in textbooks for other purposes, and occasionally notes on various concepts. Virtually everything is done in Jupyter Notebook. 

Everything within is authored by Gabriel M Steward with the exception of quoted portions and some coded fragments. The most frequent use of outside code is in the PDF conversion at the end of some notebooks, which is taken from NRPY+'s Tutorial [https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial]( https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial ). 

As this is a personal repository, nobody should have any need to push to this repository. However, if you wish to clone it (for whatever reason), run:

'git pull https://github.com/GMBlackjack/Quicksave.git'
