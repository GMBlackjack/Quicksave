    "1) The set must be closed. The operation cannot produce an element that isn't already in the set. \n",

    "2) The set must include an identity, that is, an element that, when used as an operator, changes nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Every element in the set needs to have an inverse, which is to say, an element that acts on it to make it the identity element, or undoes whatever the first operator did. \n",

We can think of the cartesian vectors with cross products as an algebra. Unlike groups, addition is also defined, but only over scalars.
