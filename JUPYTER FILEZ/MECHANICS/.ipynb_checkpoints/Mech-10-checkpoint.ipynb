    "The system, when left in isolation, will experience no acceleration in the $\\theta$ coordinate, that is of the cylinder. One might think this is odd, shouldn't the bead moving be able to take momentum away from the cylinder? Well, not necessarily, since gravity is an outside force and it's adding momentum to the bead while doing nothing to the cylinder. Furthermore, the track the bead is on is fixed to the cylinder. This does not prove that there is no momentum transfer--that's done by the math above--but it makes the result reasonable.\n",

    "Anyway, one thing we do have is a constnat, positive acceleration in $\\phi$ due to gravity. This is not surprising at all, as spinning counterclockwise (positive) produces the downward motion, and as time goes on we go downward faster and faster. Note that this downward speed doesn't care at all about the rotation of the cylinder. This makes sense: the cylinder is unable to change its rotation speed due to the lack of acceleration, and so the bead is always experiencing a constant velocity and therefore we can *always* change the reference frame to be a rotating one where the bead feels like nothing is happening but the force of gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: thinking about this again, there should probably be a coriolis force of some kind on the bead, but it is restricted to mvoe with the helix, and the rotational speed of the cylinder would have no effect on pushing it up or down. Now, if we had *friction* in the system, there would actually be a reaction force between the bead and the wire, but there is no such thing. If we start the bead relatively motionless in a stably spinning situation, it will simply slide down the helix until it gets to the bottom, whatever that may be. \n",
