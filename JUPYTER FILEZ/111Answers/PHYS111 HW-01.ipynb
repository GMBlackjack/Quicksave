    "First of all, convert the value we are given into one unit. It is most convenient to use inches, and we know that 1 ft is 12 inches, so 6 ft is 6*12 = 72 inches, so 6 ft 1 in is 73 inches. \n",

    "We are given 1 meter equals 39.37 inches, so if we divide our inches by 39.37, we will get how many meters it is. This produces a \"not nice\" decimal of 1.8542037... meters. Naturally, we need to truncate to the correct number of sig figs. It seems very likely that the 6 ft 1 inch value is an exact number, not a measruement with any precision, so we ignore the sig figs within it. We grab our significant figures from the assumed value we are provided: 39.37. It has numbers after the decimal point, which unless otherwise stated means it is not an exact value. As it has four significant figures, we determine that our answer should have four. Thus, we truncate to four places, giving us...\n",

    "\n",
    "A note: if we take 6 ft 1 in as a measurement and not an exact value, the number of sig figs will be 2. This is because we convert the number to 73 inches, which has two sig figs. There is a minor complication: we could also convert it into ft, which would make it 6.08333333.... ft going on forever. We cannot have an infinite level of precision from a measurement, though, so this is a case where a conversion could ruin us. However, note that the number 39.37 is given in inches, so we'd have to convert our new number back to inches anyway just to use it, or we'd have to convert 39.37! So it's much more reasonable to use the inches value. If you take it as a measured value, then the answer is 1.9 m."
