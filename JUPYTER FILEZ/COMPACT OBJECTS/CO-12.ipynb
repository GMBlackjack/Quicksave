    "Okay so let's think about how to do this, and what exactly the expression means. The thing is, angular momentum is conserved, so any object with any angular momentum will keep that angular momentum in an isolated particle-star system. In an isolated system this means to stay in orbit the particle would have to already *be* in orbit. The limit between being in orbit and NOT being in orbit is a parabolic trajectory: less angular momentum is an ellipse, more is a hyperbola. So what we need to do is find the angular momentum of a parabolic orbit, and that will be our limit. The only R that makes sense in this equation is the R of closest approach, as no other R except for infinity is prefered. M is the mass of the body. The mass of the particle is irrelevant as we will be dividing it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum is mvr, so our divided out angular momentum is vr. At closest approach it is vR, where v is just the velocity at that moment. By conservation of energy, we note that at infinity the particle has no speed, no energy, and no gravitaitonal potential. (This is not true for a hypebolic orbit, where the particle can truly escape--the parabola is the boundary condition, and thus has these extrema.) Thus the energy for the particle out this distant is 0. The energy at the closest point is kinetic energy, and gravitational energy--the latter of which is negative. NOTE: as the particle itself is not rotating there is no \"rotational kinetic energy\". In fact $I\\omega^2 = mv^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = \\frac12 mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = 0$$\n",
