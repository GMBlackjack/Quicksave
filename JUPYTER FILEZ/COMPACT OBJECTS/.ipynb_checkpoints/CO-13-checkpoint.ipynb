    "Not about black holes but seems simple enough and I'm curious. The luminosity we get is 1e37 erg/s over 2-24 keV. The upper mass estimate for this neutron star is 2 solar masses, so its rotational kinetic energy would be L = $\\frac12 I \\omega^2$ with I being $\\frac25 MR^2$. Neutron stars have radii on the order of 5km, or 5000m, and the mass for Her X-1 is approximately 2 solar masses, or 3.978e30 kg. Thus the total moment of inertia is a whopping 3.978e37. This thing has a *ton* of rotational kinetic energy, and that's not even taking into accout how fast it's going!\n",
    "\n",
    "1e37 erg/s needs to be converted to J/s, about 1e29 J/s. The extremely quick and dirty \"what if it lost all of this energy at ocne?\" doesn't work though, which means we have to determine a time scale or select a rotation rate. Well, we actually have a rotation rate! Her X-1 has the pulsation period of 1.24 seconds, which corresponds to the neutron star. This is 5.067 radians per second. So now we can *solve* for the time. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is how long it would take to use up *all* of its rotational kinetic energy. This would last about 159 years. While this may seem reasonable at first, this is *way* too fast for observations of the rotational period *to not change*. At the time of the publication of Compact Objects observations had been being made for 11 years. By rotational kinetic energy this should have exausted 6.9% of it already. That would definitely be noticable and the period would no longer be 1.24 seconds. So rotational kinetic energy alone cannot account for it. "

The conclusion is still the same, though, R=2.25M is where instability happens, but the OBSERVED radius is always the same. "
