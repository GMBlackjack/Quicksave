\[\label{P1}\]

\emph{Consider two particles of mass m at distances r and r+h
(h\textless\textless r) on the same vertical line from the center of the
Earth. The particles fall freely from rest at time t=0 towards the
Earth's surface. Show that an observer falling with one particle will
see the separation between the particles gradually increase. Translate
this into a quantitative statement about the observer's local inertial
frame. In particular, determine the time at which the effects of
spacetime curvature will become apparent if measurements can be made to
a precision of \(\delta h_{min}\)}

The qualitative response is easy: the ``force'' of gravity pulls harder
on things closer in than ones further away, so if two particles start at
rest, the one further down will in fact start accelerating faster than
the one higher up. The questoin is, how to formulate this precisely.

    Now since we're falling to Earth, post-Newtonian effects are not our
concern, so we can actually solve this directly with newtonian physics.
The acceleration of a test body in a gravitational field is

\[\frac{GM}{r^2}\]

So the acceleration is slightly different between two particles. If one
of the particles is considered the one with the inertial frame, it has
zero acceleration. Meanwhile, the seond particle will have an observed
acceleration of:

\[\frac{GM}{r_2^2} - \frac{GM}{r_1^2}\]

    However, this isn't in the most useful form, as those r's are the values
measured from the center of the Earth. The relation we want to find is
h, that is, the function of the distance between them as observed by the
lower particle. Well, technically speaking, the above formula is it, we
just don't have it in a good form.

What we really want is acceleration in terms of time, not in terms of
position. Time to play with the differential equations.

\[\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}\]

So as it turns out this is very much not a trivial differential equation
to solve. So we had to look it up. \hyperref[1]{1}. Its worthwhile to
write out the derivation in full.

\[ \frac{dv}{dt} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \]
\[ \Rightarrow \frac{dv}{dt} v = -\frac{GM}{r^2} v \]
\[ \Rightarrow \int \frac{dv}{dt} v dt = \int -\frac{GM}{r^2} \frac{dr}{dt} dt \]
\[ \Rightarrow \int v dv = \int -\frac{GM}{r^2} dr \]
\[ \Rightarrow v^2/2 = \frac{GM}{r}\]
\[ \Rightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\]
\[ \Rightarrow \sqrt{r} dr = \sqrt{2GM} dt \]
\[ \Rightarrow \frac23 r^{3/2} = \sqrt{2GM}t \]
\[ \Rightarrow r^{3/2} = \frac32 \sqrt{2GM}t \]
\[ \Rightarrow r = ^3\sqrt{\frac92 GMt^2} \]

    Keep in mind that this has t=0 set to the moment the particle hits the
center of the Earth. At t=0 we want a specific r, one we choose. This is
going to involve a shift of (t-dt), though the exact value of dt depends
on the initial r (let's call it R) that we want.

\[ R = ^3\sqrt{\frac92 GM} (t-dt)^{2/3} \]

Set t=0 and solve.

\[ dt = R^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac29 \frac{1}{GM}} \]

So for the second particle it is

\[ dt = (R+H)^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac29 \frac{1}{GM}} \]

So now we can actually write out an expression for h in terms of t.

\[ h = ^3\sqrt{\frac92 GM(t-(R+H)^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac29 \frac{1}{GM}})^2} - ^3\sqrt{\frac92 GM(t - R^{3/2}\sqrt{\frac29 \frac{1}{GM}})^2} \]

Now to tell if we got this right, set t=0 and h=H better come out. They
do, but we need to be careful with the sign: it vanishes when being
squared.

So with this confirmed\ldots{} Solve for t when h = 2H, for that is when
the change will become evident. Oh boy.

    Okay so we KNOW this has a solution, but the algebra is ridiculously
ugly. If we're GIVEN a value for R and H, this becomes a trivial
calculation to find t. Clearly there's a better way to formulate this
but we must move on.

To prove there is a solution, though, we set G=M=H=1 and R=1000 and plot
in Geogebra. \ldots Which we accidentally plotted on the other computer
BUT the graph shows that with those values, yes, an h=2 can be found.
Not all values will have a solution though, for in those values the
maximum h was around 13 before ``crash'' and everything breaks. Depends
on the strength of the gravity field. Now, with these values the time
was around 13000 for 2h time.

How about we try with more realistic values? Set R to the diameter of
the Earth to give ourselves plenty of distance to fall, H to one meter,
and see what happens. Wow, it takes about 0.03 seconds. This seems
wrong, which means either A) we typed numbers in badly B) the computer
has a roundoff error or C) the above answer is wrong even though it
appears to behave correctly.

Regardless, though, we can at least say ``an answer exists'' and move
on.

ALTERNATIVELY, we're overthinking it and there's some simple trick.

\[\label{P2}\]

\emph{Show that, with \(\lambda\) taken to be an affine parameter, the
Lagrangian}

\[ L = \frac12 g_{\alpha\beta} \dot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta\]

\emph{is an equivalent Lagrangian to 5.2.12 for geodesics; that is, show
that the Euler-Lagrange equations for 5.2.21 give the same geodesic
equaitons, except that now \(\lambda\) is no longer an arbitrary
parameter and the condition L=const is built in to the variational
principle.}

    5.2.12 is given by

\[ L = \sqrt{-g_{\alpha\beta} (x^\gamma) \dot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta} \]

    Now we actually do remember from our relativity work that an
\emph{affine parameter} is one that satisfies the geodesic equation. In
our old notation, thas can be thought of as:

\[ \frac{d^2x^\alpha}{d\lambda^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\beta} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\lambda} = 0 \]

    In our new notation, this is 5.2.19

\[ \ddot x^\alpha + \Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} \dot x^\beta \dot x^\gamma = 0\]

Of note 5.2.21 is just the equation given at the top.

    By the very definition of affine parameter, 5.2.19 is satisfied. So we
just need to show that the legrangians are equivalent.

The Euler-Lagrange equations are 5.2.5

\[ \frac{d}{d\lambda} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x^\alpha} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial x^\alpha} \]

As mentionedin the book, the right-hand side is zero since the L depends
only on the velocities. This means we now have:

\[ \frac{d}{d\lambda} \frac12 g_{\alpha\beta} \dot x^\beta = 0 \]

Alternatively

\[ \frac{d}{d\lambda} L / x^\alpha = 0 \]

    By the product rule

\[ \Rightarrow \frac12 g_{\alpha\beta} \frac{d}{d\lambda} \dot x^\beta +  \frac12 \dot x^\beta \frac{d}{d\lambda} g_{\alpha\beta} +  \frac12 \dot x^\beta g_{\alpha\beta} \frac{1}{x^\alpha} \frac{d}{d\lambda} x^\alpha +  \frac12 \dot x^\beta g_{\alpha\beta} x^\alpha \frac{d}{d\lambda} \frac{1}{x^\alpha}= 0 \]

\[ \Rightarrow \frac12 g_{\alpha\beta} \ddot x^\beta +  \frac12 \dot x^\beta \dot x^\gamma g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma} = 0 \]

Multiply by 2

\[ \Rightarrow g_{\alpha\beta} \ddot x^\beta + \dot x^\beta \dot x^\gamma g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma} = 0 \]

    Now we should apply the fact that L = constant to show the Christoffel
symbol appear. The problem is we're not exactly sure how it was done in
the \emph{book\ldots{}}

Okay so we've found the step, that step is 5.2.16. It is not explained
or shown how it is accomplisehd. The Method has been identified:
L=const, therefore take the derivative with respect to the affine
parameter and play around with indeces until you explode.

We have determined the necessary condition to make the final symbol:

\[ g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma}\dot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta \dot x^\gamma = g_{\alpha\gamma,\beta}\dot x^\alpha \ddot x^\beta - g_{\gamma\beta,\alpha}\ddot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta \]

Which is the same as saying

\[ g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma} = \Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \]

\[\label{P3}\]

\emph{The metric of two-dimensional Euclidean space is
\(ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\phi^2\), leading to the Lagrangian
\(L = \frac12 (\dot r^2 + r^2 \dot \phi^2)\). Show that the equations of
moition of a test particle are
\(\ddot r - r\dot\phi^2 = 0; r^2\dot\phi = const\). (Taking
\(\lambda=t\), we recognize the usual Newtonian equations in empty
space.}

    The metric can be translated to

\[ \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & r^2 \\
\end{pmatrix} \]

    Now we can recalculate the christoffel symbols\ldots{} or just look them
up in the GR text for radial coordiantes.
\(\Gamma^r_{\theta\theta} = -r; \Gamma^\theta_{r\theta} = \Gamma^\theta_{\theta r} = 1/r; else=0\)

    Test particles are ``free falling'' and follow geodesics. Using the
geodesic equatin (which is shown in \textbf{Problem 2}) we derive the
following relations:

\[ \ddot r -r \dot \phi^2 = 0\]
\[ \ddot \phi + \frac2r \dot r \dot \phi = 0\]

    Now the first one is already one of the equations we're seeking. The
second one, however, is not, and while it might be useful we still need
to find the other one. Given the nature of the book, we need to use the
momentum. Specifically, if L is independent of one of the
coordinates\ldots{} it is in fact independent of r. Thus, we use 5.2.22:

\[ p_\alpha = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot x^\alpha} \]

Now if we take this with respect to r, we get:

\[ const = r\dot \phi^2 \]

Not what we want. Try the other one.

\[ p_\alpha = g_{\alpha\beta}\dot x^\beta = r^2 \dot\phi\]

And there it is.

It occurs to us that perhaps we prefer not working relativity from
Lagrangian mechanics.

\emph{Show that inside a uniform density star \((\rho = constant)\),}

\[ \frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{\sqrt{1-2Mr^2/R^3}-\sqrt{1-2M/R}}{3\sqrt{1-2M/R} - \sqrt{1-2Mr^2/R^3}} \]

\[ e^\Phi = \frac32 \sqrt{1-\frac{2M}{R}} - \frac12 \sqrt{1-\frac{2Mr^2}{R^3}} \]

\emph{Show that the condition \(P_c < \infty\) implies
\(\frac{2M}{R} < \frac89\). The limit given by 5.7.13 (the inequality
above) for the maximum ``compaction'' of a uniform density equilibrium
sphere applies, in fact, to spheres of arbitrary density profile, as
long as the density does not increase outwards.}

    Trying to refer to thermodynamics seems pointless, let's jsut do it with
what we have. WE know that the energy density is always constant.
However, P itself, the pressire, ranges from 0 at the edge of the star
(r=R) to some actual finite value in the core of the star.

We would very much like to know what P is in the center of the star. The
book says the equation of state will give us that simply from knowing
the energy density. We don't trust that from our work. However, we do
have bounds on our integral for certain: P=0 at r=R.

\ldots At this point we decided that we didn't study enough about star
models to even do this.
