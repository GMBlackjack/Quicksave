    "*Consider two particles of mass m at distances r and r+h (h<<r) on the same vertical line from the center of the Earth. The particles fall freely from rest at time t=0 towards the Earth's surface. Show that an observer falling with one particle will see the separation between the particles gradually increase. Translate this into a quantitative statement about hte observer's local inertial frame. In particular, determine the time at which the effects of spacetime curvature will become apparent if measurements can be made to a precision of $\\delta h_{min}$*\n",
    "\n",
    "The qualitative response is easy: the \"force\" of gravity pulls harder on things closer in than ones further away, so if two particles start at rest, the one further down will in fact start accelerating faster than the one higher up. The questoin is, how to formulate this precisely. "
