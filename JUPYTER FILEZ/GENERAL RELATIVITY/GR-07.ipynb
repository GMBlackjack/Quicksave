Still, though, the gradual incerasing or decreasing of particles would be rather interesting. Since it can't go back down or up, though, it sure seems like that would violate energy conservation... and entropy... and a whole slew of other things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if there were an alternative 7.3 that could take both positive and negative values, then that would be a different story. And something like this kind of has to be true, as at any given moment particle number in the universe is not conserved. The aforementioned virtual particles at black hole horizons kind of throw a wrench into this. (Though that theory would involve interactions between particles, which we are ignoring right now, and is probably a million times more complicated than we realize.)"
