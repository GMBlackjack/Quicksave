    "*d) Three dimensioned constants in nature are regarded as fundamental: c, G, and $\\hbar$. With c=G=1, $\\hbar$ has units $m^2$, so $\\hbar^{1/2}$ defines a fundamental unit of length called the Planck length. From table 8.1, we calculate $\\hbar^{1/2}$ = 1.616e-35. Since this number invovles the fundamental constants of relativity, gravitaiton, and quantum theory, many physicists feel that this length will play an important role in quantum gravity. Express this length in terms of the SI values of c, G, and $\\hbar$. Similarly, use the conservation factors to calculate the Planck mass and Planck time, fundamental numbers formed from c, G, and $\\hbar$ that have the units of mass and time respectively. Compare these fundamental numbers with characteristic masses, lengths, and time scales that are known from elementary particle theory.*"
