Assume that the asteroid's trajectory is such that it would miss the c\\enter of the planet by a distance b with no gravity. THis is called the **impact parameter.** Then use conservation of angular momentuym and conservation of energy to determine the periapsis distance. Hint: since hte distance that you're solving for will give you a quadratic, the periapsis is the distance where the discriminant of the quadratic is equal to zero.*"
