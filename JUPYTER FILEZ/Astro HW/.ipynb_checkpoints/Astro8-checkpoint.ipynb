In a (very) simplified model, derive an expression for the distance R from a clump of total mass M in the protoplanetary disk you can be and still remain bound to the clump when considering Keplerian shear. Take the clump to be orbiting at a distance a from the star. Hint: use energy. You may assume that R<<a*\n",

We deduce that **Jupiter is much more likely to form by disk instability** from this proportionality alone—we only know that our numbers are *related* to the amount of gas in a system, not precisely how.
