Assume a typical impact speed of 30 km/s, the same as Earth's orbital velocity. How much kinetic energy is dissipated in the impact?*\n",

Assuming the average yield to be the same as that of the American nukes, 200 kilotons, what is the radius of an asteorid impactor that would have the same energy release as the entire world arsenal comibned? Compare to the megatonnage of the 10-kilometer-diameter Chicxulub imapctor that killed the dinosaurs.*\n",

The gravitational potential at infinity is 0, the gravitational potential at the Earth's radius (the moment of impact) is GMm/r, where M is the mass of the earth and r is the earth's radius. This potential provides additional energy of 62,400,000 m. Since the energy has m in it, we correlate this directly to $v^2/2$ and get an answer for v of 11,179 m/s, or 11.179 km/2 which is *just the escape velocity*. "
