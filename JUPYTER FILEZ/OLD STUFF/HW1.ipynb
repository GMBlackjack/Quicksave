We will explore these practices in the context of a very fun and very ancient problem: computing π (i.e., the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter).*\n\n*A number of algorithms exist for computing π, and this assignment will familiarize you with some of the basic approaches. First a couple of important points:*\n\n* *You will be expected to use double-precision (IEEE-754 standard) arithmetic to complete this assignment. Most programming languages these days support this standard, including but not limited to: Python, C, C++, Java, Matlab, and FORTRAN.* **It is up to you to know how to use double-precision arithmetic in your chosen language; the basics of computer programming are not taught in this class**.\n* *For the purpose of this assignment, we will define the “exact” value of π to be the following:* **π = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288**, *which is consistent with the exact value to more than twenty significant digits – far better than double precision will give us.*\n\n*For each of the following algorithms, you are to*\n\n* *Write **by yourself, from scratch** a computer program that implements the given algorithm.*\n* *Using the plotting program of your choice, create a plot of the logarithmic relative error between the value of π your algorithm computes (i.e, the approximate value, A) and the “exact” value E given above, versus iteration I, where the set of I will be given for each algorithm. As always be sure to carefully number and label your axes; see the Syllabus for more details. Your plot will be graded according to the correctness of the result and how well you followed the directions in the Syllabus and in this assignment for creating plots.*\n\n***Logarithmic Relative Error***\n\n$$log_{10}E_{rel}=log_{10}\\left ( \\left | \\frac{E-A}{A} \\right | \\right )$$"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem 1 (10 pts)\n\n\"*Arctangent algorithm #1 \": The Gregory-Leibniz series*\n$$π=lim_{I\\rightarrow ∞} 4\\sum_{n=0}^{I}\\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}$$\n*For the plot, use* $I\\in \\left \\{ 100, 10^5, 2\\times10^5, 3\\times10^5, 4\\times10^5,...,9\\times10^5,10^6  \\right \\}$"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First of all, we note that float values in python are already double-precision, so we do not need to declare anything special.
