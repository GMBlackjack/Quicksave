    "So it's proven. That said, a note: at one point we use 2.71, since E is spatial, but on the reverse indeces. However, the reverse indeces does not change the relation since the metric can move in and out at will and no other terms in the series have a d in them. $v^dw_d = v_dw^d$ after all. So we now have the relation required for our little mathematical funhouse. "
