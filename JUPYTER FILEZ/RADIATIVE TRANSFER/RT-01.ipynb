    "This is basically a question of how much of the sun's \"sky\" is taken up by the Earth. Well, there are $4\\pi$ steradians in a sphere. Times this by the square radius to get the surface area, $4\\pi R^2$. This is 1.88e9 $km^2$. On the other end, the actual cross sectional area of the Earth is 2e7 $m^2$, so the total incident power would be the fraction of these two. The earth thus takes up 1.06e-8 of the total area, and thus receives a power of 4.077e18. W. "

He showed that for a 1% reduction in the value of the total solar irradiance $S_0$ that $\\Delta T_s = -5 C$; and for a 1.5% reduction $\\Delta T_s = -9 C$. This sensitivity is much greater than the direct effect discussed in Example 1.2, and is due to the equatorward advance in the permanent ice line as the Earth cools. In the 1.5 reduction case, the ice line is at 50 degrees N latitutde, corresponding to the southward advance of Quaternary glaciation. For a slightly greater 1.6% reduction, $\\Delta T_s = -33 C$.
