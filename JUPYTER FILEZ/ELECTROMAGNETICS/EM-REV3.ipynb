    "### Image Charges\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind image charges is actually very simple: treat any grounded conducting surface as a mirror in order to set up an \"identical situation\" with only point charges. The fields with the point charges will be identical to the fields produced by the point charge interacting with the conducting plates. If the conductors are flat plates, they act as perfect mirrors--but if there's more than one make sure to reflect the reflections. If they are spheres, the mirroring can still happen but there's rules for it. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = R^2/s$$\n",
    "$$ q' = -Rq/s $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where b is the distance from the center of the sphere of the new charge, s is the distance of the original charge, q is the old charge magnitude, q' is the new charge magnitude, and R is the sphere radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all this does is set up the electric field (and potential) because of the point charges. Now that the field is attained, what next? Usually we want to find a charge distribution on the plate or the sphere. For plates, finding the charge distribution is taken from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\epsilon_0 \\hat n \\cdot \\vec E = \\epsilon_0 \\hat z \\cdot \\vec E(z=0) = -\\epsilon_0 \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial z} \\right|_{z=0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be converted into y and x terms easily enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_x = -\\epsilon_0 \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} $$\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_y = -\\epsilon_0 \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably the plate doesn't have to be directly on the x or y axis. But at that point you might as well redefine your coordinate system so it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need total charge, at this point you integrate over the surface charge density and you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, something we did not do but could potentially be asked: what is the charge distribution on a sphere? Just take the normal to be $\\hat \\rho$ and work from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "We were told not to expect Green's functions, so they won't be on the review here. "

    "Lastly, let us consider how we use the scalar potential to find a current if we're given a potential, which is to say, workign backward.
