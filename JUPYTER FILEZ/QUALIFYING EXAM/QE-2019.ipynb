    "*A linear triatomic molecule consists of three masses free to move on one straingt line, connected by springs (all of equal elastic strength k) as shown in the figure. One atom has mass M and the two on either side of M have equal masses m. $x_i$ (i=1,2,3) are the coordinates marking the positions of the three particles on the line. At the equilibrium, $x_{02} - x_{01} = x_{03} - x_{02} = l$.*\n",

    "From inspection I know that there are two normal modes, one where the two ends are anti-oscillating and one where they oscillate in time. For each, the proper equilibrium coordinates need to be the only thing varying, and yet the two coordinates together need to describe the full range of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also we technically allow the masses to move so there's a third coordinate and a third mode but we can just represent position by the central coordinate $x_2$ and the normal \"frequency\" here is infinite as it just translates forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two are what are interesting. So, let's think about this. Consider the mode where both oscillate in time, the distance between them remains constant. The other mode, where they're anti-oscillating, the distance between them changes, but their relative difference from the center remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this with the two new coordinates $x_1 + x_3$ and $x_1 - x_3$. If we measure the origin as being at the center, $x_2$, which we really should since the translational mode is boring. In each mode only one of these quantities is changing, perfect.\n",

    "Ironically the problem seems to want us to find equilibrium coordinates for this *first*, which are ones that are entirely uncoupled, with each variable independent in the $M\\ddot q = -K q$ relations. However we do not see how to do this by inspection, and the way to do it methodically is to solve the problem first and then go back.

I mean we can do that, this molecule clearly has translational, matching, and opposing modes, but that's not very scientific now is it?\n",

    "So here's what (we think) the problem is asking. $S^2$ is what we usually deal with, composed of $S_x, S_y, S_z$. However, what if we created one of a direction that pointed in an arbitrary xz direction? \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, it may help to know what the x and z eigenstates (eigenspiniors) are. For $S_z$ it's well known:(1,0) and (0,1). For $S_x$ it's a bit different, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} (1,1)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} (1,-1)$. At any given orientation, we are either completely in z, completely in x, or somewhere in between. We can create that \"in between\" ness with the idea of rotation. When the direction is upright, we are purely in $S_z$ states. When we point down, the same is true but just in reverse, the \"negative\" case. When we are halfway between, we are purly in $S_x$. Once we pass $S_x$ the \"up\" and \"down\" definiteions for $S_z$ will change, and the same is true when we cross $S_z$. However, this flipping is accomplished by a simple flipping of the sign in the *matrix* S, not the eigenstates. \n",

One thing we do know is that the wire *is* producing a magnetic field of the normal strength everywhere, there's just an additional component.
