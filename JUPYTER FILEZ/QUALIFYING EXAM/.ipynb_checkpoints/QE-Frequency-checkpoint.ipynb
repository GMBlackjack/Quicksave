    "Note: harmonic oscillators show up a lot in a large variety of things, so be sure to have them in mind. The hydrogen atom is similar, though less often. Note that there are a large number of questions that appear only once, Quantum Mechanics appears particuarly suscpetible to drawing on entirely random things that are never asked again. The two thigns that *definitely* should be known absolutely are how to find energy level probabilities and how to use quantum hamiltonians of systems, these are almost always present. Can't say the same for the \"unusual operators\" category since while it showed up a lot, often the operators were unrealted to each other, or the question only dealt with one or two of them. Note that while Schrodinger's Equation is listed three times here, those were all on the same text, it seems that rarely are we actually quizzed on applying Schrodinger's equation. "

For instance, \"EM wave on medim boundary\" is usually on a normal mateiral, but one time it was a perfect conductor, and another time it was a mesh of super fine wires. There's not a clear preference for anything on EM questions, though induction problems show up a bit more often than expected, while solving a boundary value problem from scratch is the least common. One of the most common tricks is to have a time-dependent component in an otherwise static situation; usually statics can still be used because of prevailing assumptions, but not always. "
