The ends of the rectangle are sent to infinity, while one of the other sides is on the axis and the other is placed somewhere in complex space.

If we add an imaginary component of $2\\pi i$ the exponentials will just cycle back to where they started, and the definition does not change, and at very large values of z cosh is gonna overblow and thus reduce the value to zero at the ends. Technically speaking this only happens at the ends, what of the other values of i we pass through?
